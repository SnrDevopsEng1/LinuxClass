day 1 : intro to linux
  created in 91 by Linus Torvalds
  different flavor :
    centos
    ubuntu
    debian
    kali
    mint
    alpine
    redhat
    fedora 
    and more ....
  linux components:
    Linux is composed of several key components that work together to provide the functionality of the operating system. 
These components include:
Kernel: The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages hardware resources, controls system processes, 
and provides services to applications.
Shell: The Linux shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. 
It is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, from basic file management to complex system administration.
Filesystem: The Linux filesystem is a hierarchical structure that organizes files and directories. It is based on the Unix filesystem and provides a standardized way of accessing and storing data.
Applications: Linux supports a wide range of applications, including web browsers, office suites, media players, and development tools. Many applications are open source and can be freely downloaded and modified.
Libraries: Linux includes a large collection of libraries that provide common functionality to applications. These libraries can be used by developers to simplify the development process and make their applications more efficient.
Utilities: Linux includes a variety of utilities that provide additional functionality, such as text editors, network tools, and system monitoring tools. These utilities are often command-line based and can be used to automate tasks or perform complex operations.

Linux commands:
  
date    ==> to check the date on the server
cal     ==> to check the calendar
uptime  ==> to check how long the system have been running
clear   ==> the clear the terminal screen
free -m ==> check the total memory used and available memory
pwd     ==> print working directory ( check where you are on the server)
mkdir   ==> create folders or directories on the system
ls      ==> list directory content
touch   ==> create files 
history ==> check all previous typed commands
man     ==> manual of a command. 
nproc   ==> check number of cpu
lsblk  ==> to check block device or hard drive
lscpu  ==> check cpu info 


Day 2 :
  Linux command practice:
    

    
*** System inventory ( server decommisioning , Server end of lease, end of life. )

	uptime ==> to check how long the system have been running
    lscpu ==> check cpu info
    cat /etc/os-release  ==> os type and version
    nproc  ==> check number of cpu
    lsblk  ==> to check block device or hard drive
    uname -r ==> to check the kernel version
    top   ==> to check cpu, memory, uptime, and all the process running   
    free -m  ==> to check memory
    
*** files/directories commands
  	 mkdir  ==> to create folders
     touch  ==> to create files
     ll, ls, ls -l  ==> to list directory content
     cd  ==> to change directory
     cp, cp -r  ==> to copy files and directory 
     mv  ==> to rename a file or move it to a new location
     find ==> use to check file or directory path
     vi  ==> to edit files
     cat ==> display file content
     rm, rm -f ==> to delete files and directories
     rm -r, rm -rf  ==> to delete files and directories
    
*** Other commands:
    man
    history
    echo
  
Project1:
  1- You receive a request to create a test centos 7 server. go ahead and create it with lightsail service.
  with below specs:
   region: n. Virginia
    platform: linux
    blueprint: os only
    os :  centos 7
    keypair: N/A
    cpu: 1
    Memory: 512 MB
    Server Name: dev-test-server
      
  2- what is linux ?
  3- what are the features of linux 
  4- what is the linux architechture or  the components of linux?
  5- what is cli ?
  6- what is a shell?
  7- login remotely to the server created in question1 and do a complete inventory
  8- create a file called linux_command
  9- add 30 linux command in the file linux_command and what they are for.
  10- what is your favorite command in linux and why?

project1:
  
  Apache is the most widely used webserver software and runs on 67% of all websites in 
  the world. Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation, Apache is open source 
  software and available for free.
Itâ€™s fast, reliable, and secure. And Apache can be highly customized to meet the needs of 
many different environments by using extensions and modules.

Most WordPress hosting providers use Apache as their webserver software. However, 
WordPress can run on other webserver software as well.

  To install and config apache webserver on a linux machine, we need to follow bellow steps
for centos:

**Install apache in centos/ redhat
yum install httpd -y 

** Start , check the status and enable apache daemon
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd
systemctl enable httpd

** Create custorm content for the browser

cd /var/www/html
touch index.html
vi index.html 
<h1>This is my first website </h1>

go and refresh the browser
